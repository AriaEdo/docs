**What's the difference between "Core" and "Custom"?**  
Packet has two types of facilities: Core and Custom. All [locations](https://www.packet.com/locations/) feature our entire software / automation platform and network topology. Everything that you can do from an automation and networking perspective is the same across all locations.

The only difference is inventory. In our custom locations we stock a more limited number of configurations (currently a single "[x1.small.x86](https://www.packet.com/cloud/servers/x1-small/)"), and we don't have block storage at the custom sites.

Note: all sites are available for Private Deployments, which allow you to customize configurations in private racks on a commitment.   


**Where is each data center located? Do you have a speedtest?**  
You can access various speedtest and ping url's from this central page on our website.

Does Packet own its facilities?
While Packet is a leading force in the cloud market, we are not a real estate development firm.  

As such, we lease large amounts of space and power from colocation providers (read about our selection process and grab our RFP template).  



What kind of certifications do Packet data centers have?
While we do not offer PCI compliant hosting and rarely sign BAAs, we are deeply committed to security best practices. As such, a lot of our customers want to know about the certification status of each of our facilities.   

We rent large amounts of colocation space from Tier 1 providers like Equinix and Interxion, and each of our data centers have been certified to national and/or international security standards.
