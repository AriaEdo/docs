###Supported Operating Systems
Packet provides a range of officially supported Linux, BSD, Windows, and VMware operating systems. Images for our supported operating systems are built specifically for Packet server types and stored on our public [Github repository](https://github.com/packethost/packet-images). All supported operating systems are available for automatic installation when provisioning Packet servers via the customer portal, Packet API, or Terraform script. Visit our [main webpage](https://www.packet.com/developers/grid/) for a list of all supported operating systems and compatible server types.

###Custom iPXE
Don't see the OS you need in our supported list? No problem. We know we can't support every operating system our customers might need, so we offer a way to bring your own OS with [custom iPXE](products\03-servers\04-operating-systems\02-custom-ipxe.md). Just choose iPXE as the OS when provisioning any Packet server type, and you'll be able to supply a URL to PXE installation tools like netboot.xyz, or your own iPXE script.

###Custom Images
Our supported operating system images are designed for speed and efficiency, but that means they include a minimum number of packages. To help automate the provisioning process for our customers, and reduce time spent manually configuring fresh installs, we provide the option to tailor our supported operating system images to your needs with [Custom Images](products\03-servers\04-operating-systems\03-custom-images.md).
