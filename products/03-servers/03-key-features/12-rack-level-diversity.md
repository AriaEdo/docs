### Rack Level Diversity

Packet deploys Bare Metal servers across various racks in our facilities. Depending on the facility size, a specific server type will be available in multiple racks.

Although this information is not public yet on the customer side, Packet provides a Switch ID hash, in Portal or through API, as part of the instance details. Through this Switch ID hash, every customer should be able to understand the diversity of their servers. For the On Demand servers, a customer would provision the next available server, and we cannot always provide the diversity.

For the Reserved servers, Packet can work with the customer, to provide the needed diversity, pending availability on the specific facility.
