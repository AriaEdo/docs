As part of our Public Cloud, we provide a variety of pre-configured servers for common use cases. For these configs, we stock a large number of machines to handle growth and bursts in demand.

If hardware fails with any of these standard public cloud configurations, our SLA requires us to give you another machine. Since Packet does not keep an agent on a machine once it is provisioned, customers are responsible for monitoring the health of their hardware (e.g. drives). If hardware fails or becomes problematic, customers can request a new machine and advise our support team of any hardware issue. We do not provide a migration service for your data.

For specialized workloads, we can provide custom configurations on a contract. Interacting with custom configurations is similar to our public cloud, but inventory is obviously limited. 

If there is a problem with custom hardware, users can leverage on-demand instances or tap into Spare Hardware, which are reserved “cold spare” machines dedicated to each customer. We highly encourage a smart sparing policy and work with customers to find the right approach.
