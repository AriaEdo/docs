# Getting Started

### Our History
Packet was founded in July 2014 with a passion to build a better internet. Our mission is to empower SaaS companies and Fortune 100's alike to make infrastructure a competitive advantage with automated bare metal that can be deployed anywhere. 

With 20+ global public cloud locations, a seamless API experience, and the ability to deploy and manage custom hardware on-premises or in privately managed availability zones, Packet is ideal for both traditional and cloud native workloads. At least we think so!  :-)  

### Deploying on Packet
If you've used EC2 (AWS) or various compute services from Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or DigitalOdean then Packet will feel quite familiar. We support core concepts such as user data, and everything that can be done in our portal can be accomplished via our API.  The difference is that we only provide single-tenant bare metal compute, instead of virtual machines. 

Since we are 100% focused on the infrastructure layer, we do not provide higher level services like managed databases or serverless offerings. Instead we invest in a vibrant [http://staging.packet.net/community/partners/](partner ecosystem).

### Working with Packet
Although our platform is fully automated at all levels, we do form close relationships with many of our customers. If you have questions or feedback, we would love for you to get in touch.

### Need help?
While users are responsible for managing their own infrastructure at Packet, we offer 24/7/365 support through a variety of channels. If you experience issues, please reach out to our support team via [email](mailto:support@packet.com) or [Slack](https://slack.packet.com/).
