# **Getting Started**

## Our History 
Packet was founded in July 2014 with our passion to build a better internet. Our platform brings the price and performance benefits of bare metal servers to the cloud, powering highly-available performance workloads through a unique, never-congested network.

We offer bare metal servers, on demand \(seven minutes or less\) in our public cloud, hosted in our datacenter. We make this as automated and consistent as using things like AWS. 

With Packet bare metal, there are no noisy neighbors, shared resources, or hypervisors to gum up the works and impact your workload. Your dedicated servers are 100%, well...yours!

While our servers & services are completely unmanaged. If you experience issues with your server you can reach out to our support team via [email](mailto:support@packet.com), [Slack](http://slack.packet.com/).
