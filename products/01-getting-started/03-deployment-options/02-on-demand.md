### Deployment
Servers can be deployed On-Demand via the customer portal, API, API integration, or Terraform script. All server types found on [our webpage](https://www.packet.com/cloud/servers/) are eligible for On-Demand deployment--availability permitting. Available inventory is not guaranteed for On-Demand instance provisioning requests, see our documentation on [capacity](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/getting-started/deployment-options/capacity/) for more information about availability.

### Rate
On-Demand servers are charged a fixed rate hourly. Billing begins as soon as the server is successfully provisioned, and ends when the server has been deleted from the user's project.

### Persistence
Server instances deployed On-Demand will never be deleted by Packet without explicit permission from the instance owner, except in the event of account termination or indefinite restriction due to failure to comply with our [ToS](https://www.packet.com/about/terms/).
