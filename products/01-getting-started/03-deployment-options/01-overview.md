### Customer portal
Our [customer portal](https://app.packet.net) provides an easy GUI for deploying Packet hardware. Navigate to your desired project and click "new server" to get started. From there you'll be able to choose between [On Demand](products\03-servers\02-deployment-options\02-on-demand.md) instances, [Reserved Hardware](products\03-servers\02-deployment-options\03-reserved-hardware.md), and [Spot Market](products\03-servers\02-deployment-options\04-spot-market.md) deployment options.

### API
Need a GUI alternative? Leverage our extensive, RESTful, [API](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/) with Curl to deploy and manage hardware directly from the command line or Bash script.

### Integrations
For those looking to integrate the Packet API with their existing code, we have [integrations](https://www.packet.com/developers/libraries/) for several popular programming languages, such as Python, Golang, Java, and more.

### Terraform
Need an elegant solution for automating your Packet deployments with minimal reliance on code? Terraform is the way to go. Checkout the [Packet provider page](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/packet/index.html) for all the info you need to get started provisioning Packet hardware with Terraform.
