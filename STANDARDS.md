### How to link images properly?

In our markdown files we use relational links to link images from `/images` directory:

```
/images/file-name/image-name
```

`file-name` is the name of the file (wihtout .md or any other extension at the end), which includes the images we want to link.

`image-name` is the name of a particular image within a file. Make sure to use appropriate and clear names for image files.
