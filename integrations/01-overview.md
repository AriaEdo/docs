One of the most important things we do as a cloud provider is to ensure that we support an enjoyable and productive experience for users. The vast majority of utilization on our cloud occurs via our API, usually through a tool like Terraform or Ansible. 

If you have feedback about our support for a tool (or see a gap we can fill) please open an issue or email us via [support@packet.com](mailto:support@packet.com).
