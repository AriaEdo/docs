## What is Hybrid Cloud?

Hybrid Cloud is a heterogeneous infrastructure architecture that refers to a combination of computing, storage, and service environments which combine the benefits of public cloud and private cloud services. Hybrid clouds depend on interconnectivity which enable workloads to be moved, management to be unified, and processes orchestrated. The public and private clouds remain separate and unique entities, operating independently of one another while working together over encrypted connections using technology that allows for portable data and applications. Many hybrid clouds are architected to not focus on connecting the environments themselves, but the portability of apps that run in the environments.

## Why Use a Hybrid Cloud Environment?

Classic solutions such as public and private cloud infrastructures generally sit at opposite ends of the infrastructure spectrum and while effective can make it difficult for a business to meet all of it’s infrastructure needs. Hybrid cloud solutions give businesses the best of both worlds, giving them the agility they need to meet their growing business needs.

## The Different Types of Clouds

Public Cloud architecture has all infrastructure located off site, hosted by a separate service provider. This style of architecture generally allows for greater flexibility with cost savings, reliability, and scalability. However, all infrastructure is hosted by a service provider which can be trickier to build on as a platform, data is externalized, and generally these services are a one size fits all, which is not ideal for companies who use sensitive data or are subject to compliance regulations of any type.

Private Cloud architecture means that all infrastructure and hosting are not shared, and are entirely controlled by the customer. Private clouds can provide the highest level of security, control, and customization. While being very flexible and secure, private clouds generally have more up-front costs, require infrastructure management(maintenance, upgrading, disaster recovery), and can be complex to implement effectively(security, data storage, networking, etc.).

Hybrid cloud architecture represents the best of both worlds, giving businesses the agility they need to meet their growing business needs. It grants the ability to have greater control and flexibility over private and public components. This prevents cloud solutions from being limited to the resources of private clouds or the prepackaged public cloud offerings, enabling teams to have more flexibility and efficiency to meet disparate needs; workloads can be divided across clouds to reach capacity and performance needs, meeting spikes in demand, and avoiding downtimes, all without impacting private cloud workloads. By mitigating variable workloads and applications, hybrid clouds often offer cost savings. Plus, it enables a separation of sensitive data for security, allowing teams to meet regulatory standards and requirements.

## Common Hybrid Cloud Uses
Most teams today have applications and workloads that are stuck somewhere between private and public clouds. Common opportunities for optimization with hybrid cloud are:
 - SaaS Integrations - Teams adopting SaaS offerings available to cloud offerings can be connected to existing environments to bring new solutions to teams, enabling them to move faster.
 - Enhancing Legacy Apps - Hybrid cloud lets teams take their legacy applications, upgrade the user experience, and deploy them globally, modernizing their offerings.
 - Modern Integrations - Teams can deepen their user experience by integrating new data sources and AI offerings available on the public cloud like IoT, weather, social, CRM, etc with machine learning.

## Hybrid Cloud on Packet
While there are numerous ways of implementing a hybrid cloud solution, Packet has created an ecosystem of support around the following hybrid cloud solution providers, making it easier for you to have hybrid cloud solutions on bare-metal.

## Getting Started
Setting up a hybrid cloud solution on Packet doesn’t need to be hard. Packet supports various hybrid cloud solutions, find more information on supported hybrid cloud solutions below.
