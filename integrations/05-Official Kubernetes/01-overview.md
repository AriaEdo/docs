While Packet does not offer a managed Kubernetes service, we do place a lot of emphasis on maintaining integrations with core parts of this fast-evolving ecosystem. In this section, you can find details about our CSI, CCM, Autoscaler and related investments. We welcome any feedback!

In addition, Packet is a strong supporter of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) including the [Community Infrastructure Lab](https://www.cncf.io/community/infrastructure-lab/).
